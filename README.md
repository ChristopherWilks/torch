Currently Torch is for comparing various probabilistic data structures for use in D/RNA k-mer counting.

These include:
-Multi layer spectral bloom filters (BF2)
-Count-min sketch w/ log counter (CML)
-Slim-fat sketch (SF)
-Counting Quotient Filter (CQF)

Also contains a copy of the main scripts from:
